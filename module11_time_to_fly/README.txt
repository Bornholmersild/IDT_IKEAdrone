1. To run, firstly build the ROS2 Workspace: colcon build

2. Source the Workspace: source /install/setup.bash

3. run mavros with your telemetry plugged in
    >  ensure QGroundControl has SiK radio auto-connect disabled (see confluence)

ros2 launch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:='/dev/ttyACM0:57600' gcs_url:='udp://@0.0.0.0:14550'


4. In a new terminal: source /install/setup.bash

Note: the first waypoint is assumed to be your takeoff location, at which it will fly to 
5 meters in altitude before starting the flight.

### Text files ###
NB: Ensure that the waypoints are contained in the log file in the following format:

latitude, longitude, altitude
example: 55.4717713,10.325005,10.0


5. to run the node with text files: 
ros2 run idt upload_mission <path_to_waypoints.txt>

### .plan files ###
The code can also parse .plan files generated by QGroundControl or your own methods
The supported commands for .plan files include: 
16 (waypoint), 20 (takeoff), 22 (return to home)

5. to run the node with .plan files 
ros2 run idt upload_mission <path_to_.plan>
